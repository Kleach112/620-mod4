{"title": "Lady May", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm a stone's throw from the mill\nAnd I'm a good walk to the river\nWhen my workin' day is over\nWe'll go swim our cares away\nPut your toes down in the water\nAnd a smile across your face\nAnd tell me that you love me\nLovely Lady May\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow I ain't the sharpest chisel\nThat your hands have ever held\nBut darlin' I could love you well\n'Til the roll is called on high\nI've seen my share of trouble\nAnd I've held my weight in shame\nBut I'm baptized in your name\nLovely Lady May\n\n[Verse 3]\nLord the wind can leave you shiverin'\nAs it waltzes o'er the leaves\nIt's been rushin' through my timber\n'Til your love brought on the spring\nNow the mountains all are blushin'\nAnd they don't know what to say\n'Cept a good long line of praises\nFor my lovely Lady May\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow I ain't the toughest hickory\nThat your ax has ever fell\nBut I'm a hickory just as well\nI'm a hickory all the same\nI came crashin' through the forest\nAs you cut my roots away\nAnd I fell a good long ways\nFor my lovely Lady May\n"}
