{"title": "Turtles All The Way Down", "lyrics": "[Spoken Intro]\n\nI've seen Jesus play with flames\nIn a lake of fire that I was standing in\nMet the devil in Seattle\nAnd spent 9 months inside the lions den\nMet Buddha yet another time\nAnd he showed me a glowing light within\nBut I swear that God is there\nEvery time I glare in the eyes of my best friend\n\nSays my son, \"It's all been done\nAnd someday you're gonna wake up old and gray\nSo go and try to have some fun\nShowing warmth to everyone\nYou meet and greet and cheat along the way\"\n\nThere's a gateway in our minds\nThat leads somewhere out there, far beyond this plane\nWhere reptile aliens made of light\nCut you open and pull out all your pain\nTell me how you make illegal\nSomething that we all make in our brain\nSome say you might go crazy\nBut then again it might make you go sane\n\nEvery time I take a look\nInside that old and fabled book\nI'm blinded and reminded of\nThe pain caused by some old man in the sky\nMarijuana, LSD\nPsilocybin, and DMT\nThey all changed the way I see\nBut love's the only thing that ever saved my life\n\nSo don't waste your mind on nursery rhymes\nOr fairy tales of blood and wine\nIt's turtles all the way down the line\nSo to each their own 'til we go home\nTo other realms our souls must roam\nTo and through the myth that we all call space and time\n"}
