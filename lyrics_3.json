{"title": "Ode to Billy Joe", "lyrics": "It was the third of June\nAnother sleepy, dusty Delta day\nI was out chopping cotton\nAnd my brother was baling hay\nAnd at dinner time we stopped\nAnd walked back to the house to eat\n\nAnd Mama hollered out the back door\nY'all remember to wipe your feet\nAnd then she said\nI got some news this morning from Choctaw Ridge\nToday, Billy Joe MacAllister\nJumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\n\nAnd Papa said to Mama\nAs he passed around the black eyed peas\nWell, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense\nPass the biscuits, please\nThere's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow\n\nAnd Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow\nSeems like nothing ever comes\nTo no good up on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\n\nAnd Brother said he recollected\nWhen he and Tom and Billie Joe\nPut a frog down my back\nAt the Carroll County picture show\n\nAnd wasn't I talking to him\nAfter church last Sunday night?\nI'll have another piece of apple pie\nYou know it don't seem right\n\nI saw him at the sawmill\nYesterday on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd now you tell me\nBillie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\n\nAnd Mama said to me\nChild, what's happened to your appetite?\nI've been cookin' all morning\nAnd you haven't touched a single bite\n\nThat nice young preacher\nBrother Taylor dropped by today\nSaid he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday\nOh, by the way\nHe said he saw a girl\nThat looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd she and Billy Joe\nWas throwing something off the Tallahatchie Bridge\n\nA year has come 'n' gone\nSince we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe\nAnd Brother married Becky Thompson\nThey bought a store in Tupelo\n\nThere was a virus going 'round\nPapa caught it and he died last spring\nAnd now Mama doesn't seem\nTo wanna do much of anything\n\nAnd me\nI spend a lot of time\nPickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd drop them into the muddy water\nOff the Tallahatchie Bridge\n"}
